                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “The idea behind the Livestream mix came to me during the lockdown while I was going through old archive records, listening and reflecting back on the Techno that I began playing as a DJ.
                    I gathered together about 50 cherished records that I played in the first Techno club night I DJ’ed at and helped co run called ‘Planet Dub’ and I thought about putting together a mix to capture the essence of the amazing music from that time, some of which laid the blueprints for what was the come in the future of Techno”

            <h2>Dark Stream Vol 11 - Jay Galligan & Dual</h2>
                <p>
                    RLSD Dark Stream is back for the 11th edition with a very special AV mix from Jay Galligan and visual artist Dual_000
                    Jay Galligan is a name that will be very familiar to anyone who going to techno gigs in Dublin in the 2000s, holding down a long term residency at the legendary Elecric City and also running his own night Test which would regularly host the best in Irish and international electronic artists. We have also worked with Jay in the past on the BTC events which saw Robert Hood, James Ruskin, Claro Intelecto & Delta Funktionnen play. A brilliant dj to boot, Jay has a deep understanding of electronic music which clearly shines through in this mix. Here are a few words from the man himself:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "The concept for this mix came from collating the past 6 months of tunes I had collected for the Room 237 radio show I have been hosting with Marcus 237 aka Black Amiga. I had taken a break from listening to a lot of electronic music. It wasn’t planned but the return to it was spurred on by Marcus giving me a kick up the arse by giving me slots at his night. Fair props to him for getting the boot out.
                    The break from tunes was probably about 2 years in duration and a lot had changed in electronic music in that time. I had to get reconnected with ‘what was what’ and rediscover what I liked when reviewing all the new music that had emerged. It was super enjoyable and I suppose this is where I found the inertia to curate / programme the radio show with Black
                    Amiga.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The video mix was recorded after a meal in Marcus and Ursula’s house. Completed in one take. Ursula aka Dual_000 is an incredible visual artist and videographer specialising in video art, music promos and live AV. Working with filmed footage captured from a variety of sourced content, she experiments with CCTV, VHS and CRT monitors and analogue hardware to create a visual collage of imagery combined with granular textures, effects and errors. Her ability to edit live analogue visuals is astounding and we really wanted to add a different perspective to the video DJ set format"
