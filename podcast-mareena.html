                Mareena developed her musical career in synchronicity with the steady advancement of techno and house after growing up in the GDR where techno emerged in the '90s. As a result of her experiences within the diverse musical landscape of Berlin, she has developed her own distinct sensibility for musical narrative. This evolution led naturally to DJ gigs in many notable venues and organisations such as Berghain, About Blank, Griessmühle, De School, Tangent Gallery in Detroit during Movement Festival, The Bunker New York, Monasterio Moscow, IfZ and most prominently her residency at Tresor since 2012.

                <br>
                Her influences skew trends and rather take root in Detroit and Chicago acid, growing to encompass the more hypnotic take on dub, ambient, and broken beats as well. Throughout the years she has performed extensively both locally and internationally, including tours in Australia, North-America, and in South America with the Goethe Institute. With this, she has accomplished the rare feat of earning a reputation solely as a DJ and curator due to her empathetic energy and vibrant disposition behind the decks. However, she has been quietly working away at her music studio, refining her composition skills and deepening her musical knowledge.
                <br>
                <br>
                As one of the curators of the New Faces nights as well as the founder of the UNRUSH podcast, event series and record label, Mareena has continuously crafted new conduits for both established and emerging artists to break down musical barriers and transform the world around them. As a DJ she is a chameleon, carefully stitching together immaculate and immersive sounds that will quickly turn any discerning dance floor into a sweaty rave. Whether she is playing peak time, warm-up, or after hour, her sound reveals an intelligent eclecticism fused with bold elements of surprise that exemplify her rich knowledge of electronic music culture and history. Dynamic techno sets in clubs and lush ambient sets in churches create a balance within Mareena's musical sphere, and one can immediately sense that she feels at home no matter the setting.
